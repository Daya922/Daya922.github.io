  For some, life starts  as soon as they graduate from collegue and for many life starts as soon as challenges transmute into opportunities that  mostly resemble a propelled course of obstacles.  Software Engineer is a career track that will quickly take me into a higher pay salary compared to my actual job as a delivery driver ,and this is foremost the main reason of the why I decided to become a Software Engineer.
  Because  Software Engineer makes it  a fulfilling career where you can develop the skills to build apps of your own, I believe is a doorway for the mundane to be turn into a creativity outlet. I  absolutely like that involves troubleshooting and there is  an element  that fascinates me about breaking down problems into pieces and come into a solution. In the past ,I have been drawn to jobs that involves troubleshooting and it is something I enjoy doing it. As a plus, it involves teamwork and collaboration which makes it an enriching experience as being part of a human.
